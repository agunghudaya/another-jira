# My Go Backend

This is a simple Go backend application designed to demonstrate the structure and functionality of a Go web server.

## Project Structure

```

│   └── main.go         # Entry point of the application
├── pkg
│   └── handlers
│       └── handler.go  # Contains request handlers
├── go.mod              # Module definition and dependencies
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd be
   ```

2. Initialize the Go module:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   go run cmd/main.go
